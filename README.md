# NovaScript

_NovaScript_ is a programming language built to serve as a **learning platform** for
people interested in language development.

The structure of the project is based on the collaborative creation of a
programming language, _NovaScript_, documented in a sort of diary ([the book](https://mitra98t.github.io/NovaScript/introduction.html)).

## Philosophy

Someone interested in language development could come and take a look at the
book to understand and follow the creation of a language.
Not only understanding how it works, but also understanding the reasoning behind the
implementation choices and hopefully learning something.
The Book serves to show the process behind the creation of a language showing
the challenges as they come up.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome, at the moment I have to decide on guidelines to
establish.
In the meanwhile I will personally check the pull requests and try to give
appropriate feedback.
