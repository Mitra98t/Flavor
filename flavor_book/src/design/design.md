# Design

The design of the language is a fun, imaginative step where we get to figure out
how _Flavor_ will look like and what will be the implications. I feel that in
this step we are doing an exercise of creativity, software engineering, and
problem solving.

## Introduction to the Design Phase

Having already explored the fundamentals of language development — including
syntax, semantics, parsing techniques, type systems, and other — we are now
ready to turn our attention to the design phase.
This phase is where the theoretical meets the practical: where the abstract
concepts and principles previously discussed come together to shape the unique
identity of _Flavor_.

Designing a programming language is both an art and a science. It requires
balancing competing goals such as expressiveness, simplicity, performance, and
usability.  
Every design choice ripples through the language, affecting how users
write code, how the compiler or interpreter processes it, and ultimately, how
effective the language is at solving real-world problems.
_But no pressure._

In this section, we will expore the key design decisions that define
_Flavor_. We will examine the rationale behind choosing specific language
features, syntax styles, and semantic rules. Many of these decisions will
reference concepts covered earlier in the book, such as:

- How the **syntax and grammar** influence both the language’s readability and
  the complexity of the parser.
- The impact of the **type system** on safety, flexibility, and developer
  experience.
- Trade-offs in **memory management** strategies and how they affect performance
  and ease of use.
- Approaches to **error handling** that balance robustness with clear,
  actionable feedback for programmers.
- The paradigms and programming models that _Flavor_ embraces, informed by our
  discussion on language paradigms.

Throughout this phase, we encourage a mindset of exploration and iteration.
Language design, I find, is rarely linear or final on the first try. Instead, it evolves
through experimentation, feedback, and reflection. By understanding the
reasoning behind each choice, contributors and users alike will gain insight
into the language’s goals and how they shape its implementation.

As we progress, you will see how these design decisions map directly to the
codebase covered in the [Implementation](../implementation/implementation.md)
section, creating a cohesive narrative from concept to concrete realization.
